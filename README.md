Custom component for Home Assistant to interact with smart devices via the VeSync platform.
This integration is heavily based on [VeSync_bpo](https://github.com/borpin/vesync-bpo) and relies on [pyvesync](https://github.com/webdjoe/pyvesync) under the hood.

## Logging

### Enable debug logging

#### Via Home Assistant UI

Navigate to the Vesync integration and click on `Enable debug logging`. Restart Home Assistant. Give it a few minutes and navigate back to the Vesync integration and disable debug logging. A local log file will get downloaded to your device.

#### YAML Method

The [logger](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logger/) integration lets you define the level of logging activities in Home Assistant. Turning on debug mode will show more information about unsupported devices in your logbook.

```yaml
logger:
  default: error
  logs:
    custom_components.vesync: debug
    pyvesync: debug
```
